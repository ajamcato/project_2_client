## General Assembly: SEI Project 2 Front End Client
The purpose of this application will serve as tool for coaches to add NBA prospect
basketball players to their team roster. This application will enable users to input
details about each basketball player within their account.

## Planning Story
 Using the technologies I've learned in class thus far in Unit 2, the first step of building the full stack web application started with creating the the sign in/ sign up forms before proceeding to anything else. My next approach consisted of creating the forms that would be used to CRUD. I approached this project by focusing on building the API aspect of the project, then moved to add light css styles. My future goal for improving the project would be creating the web application to be mobile friendly.
